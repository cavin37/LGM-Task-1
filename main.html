        <p>Android is an open source and Linux-based Operating System for mobile devices such as smartphones and tablet computers.<br>
            Android was developed by the Open Handset Alliance, led by Google, and other companies.<br>
            Android offers a unified approach to application development for mobile devices<br><br> 
            which means developers need only develop for Android, and their applications should be able to run on different devices powered by Android.<br>
            The first beta version of the Android Software Development Kit (SDK) was released by Google in 2007 where as the first commercial version,<br>
            Android 1.0, was released in September 2008.<br><br>
            On June 27, 2012, at the Google I/O conference, Google announced the next Android version, 4.1 Jelly Bean.<br>
            Jelly Bean is an incremental update, with the primary aim of improving the user interface, both in terms of functionality and performance.<br>
            The source code for Android is available under free and open source software licenses. Google publishes most of the code under the Apache<br>
            License version 2.0 and the rest, Linux kernel changes, under the GNU General Public License version 2.</p><br><br>
        <h2><u>History of Android</u></h2>
        <p>Android Inc. was founded in Palo Alto, California, in October 2003 by Andy Rubin, Rich Miner, Nick Sears, and Chris White.[20][21] Rubin described the Android project as having "tremendous potential in developing smarter mobile devices that are more aware of its owner's location and preferences".[21] The early intentions of the company were to develop an advanced operating system for digital cameras, and this was the basis of its pitch to investors in April 2004.[22] The company then decided that the market for cameras was not large enough for its goals, and five months later it had diverted its efforts and was pitching Android as a handset operating system that would rival Symbian and Microsoft Windows Mobile</p>
